/**
 * Abstract base class for stroke smoothing and interpolation algorithms.
 *
 * Line smoothers process raw touch input and generate smooth, interpolated points
 * along the stroke path. This is essential for creating natural-looking brush strokes
 * from discrete touch events.
 *
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - **Smoothing**: Reduce jitter and noise from touch input
 * - **Interpolation**: Generate additional points between touch samples
 * - **Spacing**: Ensure consistent spacing between brush stamps
 * - **Direction calculation**: Compute stroke direction for brush rotation
 *
 * Different implementations provide various smoothing algorithms:
 * - [BasicSmoother]: Simple linear interpolation with fixed spacing
 * - [BezierLineSmoother]: Smooth curves using quadratic BÃ©zier interpolation
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. [setFirstPoint] - Initialize with the first touch point
 * 2. [addPoints] - Process additional touch points as they arrive
 * 3. [setLastPoint] - Finalize the stroke with the last touch point
 *
 * The smoother calls [OnDrawPoint] for each generated point, which is typically
 * handled by a drawing engine to render brush stamps.
 *
